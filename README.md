# Risk prediction of Covid-19 Vaccine Adverse event by using Bayesian network
### the most effective way to against COVID-19 
spreading is vaccines. The vaccines that is widespread in any 
countries are Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Janssen (Johnson & 
Johnson), etc. However, technology behind to develop the 
vaccines are also different such as mRNA, Viral vector, and In 
activated vaccine. Too early launching the vaccines would affect 
side effect and adverse events depends on patients. This paper 
exhibit Bayesian Network to construct the model for predicting 
the adverse event. The aim of this research is to calculate 
probabilities of adverse event in based case (considering only the 
dataset) and predict the probabilities in observed nodes from 
particular scenarios. A previous study reveals the medical idiom 
in the Bayesian network as a useful instrument to construct the 
model. In fact, cause-consequence idiom is the most utilized in 
the graphical network. In terms of methodology, this paper
would deploy pybbn framework to elicit the model and using 
NetworkX to visualise the model. Furthermore, the dataset is 
extracted from VAERs of CDC and data consist of the adverse 
event report in United State (Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & 
Johnson vaccines). The analysis from this model reveals that the
possibility of patients who are only got first dose from Pfizer and 
Moderna is likely to die if patients have severe comorbidity or 
complications. Whilst probability of death case in Johnson & 
Johnson is lower than a half. All vaccine brands would be 
positively affect to reduce death event due to infect COVID-19. 
In further research, the author would expand the Bayesian 
network model, including other symptom (complications), 
comorbidity or chronic disease, and allergies
